# OCR Image Processing with OpenCV and API Integration

This project provides a Python script for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images. The script preprocesses images to enhance contrast, reduce noise, and apply language-specific thresholding. It then sends the processed images to a specified OCR API endpoint for text extraction.

## Features
- Supports various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG)
- Adaptive preprocessing for different languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
- Uses OpenCV for image enhancement and noise reduction
- Integrates with an external API for OCR processing
- Supports both image and text file inputs

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- OpenCV
- Requests
- dotenv
- PyMuPDF (optional, for PDF support)
